## Production Environment

The production environment is where the APIs are used in real-world scenarios with live data. This environment must be extremely stable, secure, and optimized for performance.

- **Base URL**: `https://rootkey.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com`
- **Network**: [Polygon Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)
- **Usage**: All data and operations in this environment are real and should be handled with care.

### Key Features
- High availability and reliability.
- Data is persistent and used in live applications.
- Suitable for end-users and live integrations.

## Staging Environment

The staging environment is used for testing and development. It mirrors the production environment but uses test data and networks. This environment allows developers to test their changes before deploying them to production.

- **Base URL**: `https://dev-rootkey.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com`
- **Network**: [Polygon Testnet (Amoy)](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/)
- **Get Test Tokens**: [Funding Wallets with Faucet](/pages/funding_(Amoy))
- **Usage**: All data and operations in this environment are for testing purposes only and can be reset or modified without impacting real users.

### Key Features
- Simulates the production environment for thorough testing.
- Data can be reset or modified frequently.
- Ideal for developers and QA teams to test new features and fixes.

## Differences Between Production and Staging

| Feature       | Production                       | Staging                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Base URL**  | `https://rootkey.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com`    | `https://dev-rootkey.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com` |
| **Network**   | Polygon Mainnet                  | Polygon Testnet (Amoy)              |
| **Data**      | Real data                        | Test data                             |
| **Usage**     | Live applications and users      | Development and testing               |
| **Reliability** | High                            | Moderate                              |

By understanding these environments and their differences, developers can ensure that their changes are thoroughly tested in staging before being deployed to production, thereby minimizing risks and ensuring a stable, reliable experience for end users.
