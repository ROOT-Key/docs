## Unified Production Environment

The Rootkey API operates through a single production endpoint that supports both **live** and **sandbox (test)** operations. This approach allows users to test and validate integrations without switching URLs or risking unintended costs.

- **Base URL**: `https://api.rootkey.ai`
- **Network**: Polygon (Mainnet or Testnet, depending on mode)
- **Configuration**: Controlled directly from the Rootkey platform

Traffic routing (production vs. sandbox) is determined by:
1. The **mode selected** in the platform (Test Mode or Live Mode)
2. The **API key** associated with that mode

This design simplifies development workflows and reduces configuration errors.

## Sandbox (Test Mode)

Sandbox mode allows users to safely test their integrations using the same API endpoint, without generating real costs or affecting live data.

### How it works
1. Enable **Test Mode** in the Rootkey platform  
2. Generate a **sandbox API key**  
3. All requests made with this key are automatically routed to the sandbox environment

- **Network**: [Polygon Testnet (Amoy)](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/)
- **Data**: Test-only, non-persistent
- **Costs**: None

### Key Characteristics
- Identical API behaviour to production
- No financial impact during testing
- Ideal for development, QA, and pre-production validation
- No URL changes required

---

## Live Mode (Production Usage)

Once testing is complete, moving to live usage is straightforward and requires no code changes.

### Steps to go live
1. Disable **Test Mode** in the platform  
2. Generate a **new live API key**  
3. Start sending requests using the same base URL

- **Network**: [Polygon Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/)
- **Data**: Real, persistent
- **Costs**: Applied according to the active pricing plan

### Key Characteristics
- High availability and reliability
- Optimised for real-world workloads
- Suitable for end-users and production integrations

## Sandbox vs Live Mode Overview

| Feature            | Sandbox (Test Mode)            | Live Mode (Production)        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Base URL**       | `https://api.rootkey.ai`       | `https://api.rootkey.ai`      |
| **API Key**        | Sandbox key                    | Live key                      |
| **Network**        | Polygon Testnet (Amoy)         | Polygon Mainnet               |
| **Data**           | Test data                      | Real data                     |
| **Costs**          | None                           | Applied                       |
| **Purpose**        | Testing and validation         | Live operation                |

## Summary

By unifying production and sandbox access under a single endpoint, Rootkey enables a smoother transition from testing to live operation. Users can validate their cyber resilience solutions without unnecessary complexity, then move to production instantly by switching mode and API key.

This approach minimises risk, avoids accidental costs, and accelerates time to value.
