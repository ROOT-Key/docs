The ROOTKey API uses api keys to authenticate requests.

You can view and manage your api keys in your Account Settings on ROOTKey Platform.

API requests are authenticated using a custom header. To authenticate a request, provide the token in the `x-api-key` header of the request:

API Keys are tied to the ROOTKey user account for which they were created. **A api key provides the same level of access & privileges that its associated ROOTKey user account would have.**

<Warning>
Please be sure to keep your API Keys secure! Do not share them in emails, chat messages, client-side code or publicly accessible sites.

If you have accidentally shared an API Key publicly, you can revoke it in the [Account Settings](https://platform.rootkey.ai/settings) of your ROOTKey user account by clicking the X button beside the key.
