## About DAMC

DAMC (Decentralized Asset maintenance control) is a solution designed to guarantee the lifetime persistence of company asset data.

Promises an immutable and resilient maintenance record for life, while being deployed in a zero-trust ecosystem, where neither entity (the asset owner nor the maintenance subcontractor) needs to rely on the other.

A solution that will increase the value of the final asset, as well as helping to extend its useful life.

  Increase the resale value by using more reliable and autonomous technologies
  to guarantee the integrity of turbine maintenance records. Allow the sale of
  100% of the assets sold instead of 90%, since many companies have to hold 10%
  as collateral for the buyer
